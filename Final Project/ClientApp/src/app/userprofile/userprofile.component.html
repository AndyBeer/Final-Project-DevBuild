<p>if logged in:
    - user info displayed
    - user logout button
    - if user_parks has data, show list of parks (can we use code from search or park list?)
    - if no parks, tell user their list is empty, route to search or list
</p>
<p>if not logged in:
    - show form to input user name and password
    - call user table to confirm if user exists AND if pwd match
    - if password/user matches, update boolean isLoggedIn on the DB table, flip user screen to above
    - if user/pwd do not match, notify user to try again.
    - have a Create User button that routes the user to the Create User component
</p>

<h4>Y'all ready for this?</h4>
<div *ngFor="let user of users">
    <p>{{user.first_Name}}</p>
</div>
