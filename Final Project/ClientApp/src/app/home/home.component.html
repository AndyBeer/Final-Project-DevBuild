  <p>The United States is home to hundreds of National Parks and park units. 
      Although there are technically 63 National Parks within the United States,
      hundreds of other 'units' (e.g., Battlefields, Lakeshores, Memorials and Military Parks)
      encompass the breadth of our American conservation efforts.

<h3 class="adventure">What is a 'National Park?'</h3>

<div>
  <p>National Parks are designed to preserve natural and cultural resources for enjoyment, education and inspiration. 
      These differ from National Forests, which exist to sustain the productivity of the Nationâ€™s forests and grasslands 
      to meet the needs of present and future generations.</p>

<!-- <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>Welcome to your new single-page application, built with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href='https://get.asp.net/'>ASP.NET Core</a> and <a href='https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx'>C#</a> for cross-platform server-side code</li>
  <li><a href='https://angular.io/'>Angular</a> and <a href='http://www.typescriptlang.org/'>TypeScript</a> for client-side code</li>
  <li><a href='http://getbootstrap.com/'>Bootstrap</a> for layout and styling</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you get started, we've also set up:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Client-side navigation</strong>. For example, click <em>Counter</em> then <em>Back</em> to return here.</li>
  <li><strong>Angular CLI integration</strong>. In development mode, there's no need to run <code>ng serve</code>. It runs in the background automatically, so your client-side resources are dynamically built on demand and the page refreshes when you modify any file.</li>
  <li><strong>Efficient production builds</strong>. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and your <code>dotnet publish</code> configuration automatically invokes <code>ng build</code> to produce minified, ahead-of-time compiled JavaScript files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ClientApp</code> subdirectory is a standard Angular CLI application. If you open a command prompt in that directory, you can run any <code>ng</code> command (e.g., <code>ng test</code>), or use <code>npm</code> to install extra packages into it.</p> -->
